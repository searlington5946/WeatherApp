# WeatherApp

This is a completed solution of the WeatherApp assignment for CIS2543.  It's based on the tutorial found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/cross-platform/tools-for-cordova/first-steps/build-your-first-app).

## Improvements

* Added this README.md
* Added degree and heading information to the weather data list (see: compass.js)
* Created favicon.ico
* Added a fun easter egg (read the source to find it!)
* Commented out annoying "Cordova Demo" footer
